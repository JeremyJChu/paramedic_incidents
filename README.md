# Paramedic Life Threatening Medical Emergencies vs COVID-19 Epidemic Curve: Exposing the Toronto Neighbourhood Gap
This is an R project. Sourcing from the city of Toronto's [Open Data Portal] (https://open.toronto.ca/), this project performs explaratory data analysis (EDA) on the [Paramedic Services Incident Dataset] (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/paramedic-services-incident-data/) and the [COVID-19 Cases in Toronto Dataset] (https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/covid-19-cases-in-toronto/). Investigating whether the data showed an increase in life threatening respiratory/cardiac (coded as Echo) emergencies in 2020 as compared to previous years, we find out that 2020 not only had the highest Echo-level emergencies in recent years, but also that the incident trend closely mirror that of COVID-19's epidemic curve. Incidents and cases peak at April, stabilize in the summer, before sharply rising again in October and remanining high for the rest of the year.
